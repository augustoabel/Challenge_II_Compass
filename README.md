## Challenge

This challange is from Compass UOL for the interns to complete and learn experiences.
The main objective was to build a SPA (Single Page Application) based on the design in Figma.<br><br>
To accomplish this task, we have to use the React library for building the interface and another libraries and frameworks.<br><br>
This project contains:
- the login page, using the TMDB API to authenticate the user to access signing up or as a guest;
- the main page, with access to all the movies and TV Show's included in TMDB API;
- the sections about Movies, TV Show's and Actors;
- the "My List" page, with favorites and "watch later" choices by the user.

## Considerations

While developing this application, we faced some challenges that helped to learn experience. Here are some examples:

- To work as a team, delegating jobs for everyone and to merge the branchs, resolving the conflicts between them;
- To use new libraries and frameworks we are not used to, learning the documentation about wich one;
- To use the TMDB API, to fetch all the elements we needed and to do the user authentication.
